Project Description – EcoFind: Sustainable Student Marketplace

EcoFind is a web-based platform designed exclusively for students to promote sustainability, affordability, and collaboration within educational communities. The platform enables students to buy, sell, exchange, or donate products such as books, stationery, electronics, furniture, clothing, and other essentials. In addition to the product marketplace, EcoFind also features a service exchange system, where students can offer or request services like tutoring, assignment/project assistance, event support, design, and technical help.

The core idea behind EcoFind is to build a student-centered circular economy where resources are reused instead of wasted and skills are shared among peers. By creating a verified, student-only ecosystem, EcoFind ensures safety, trust, and accessibility.
