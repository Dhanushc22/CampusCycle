Got it ✅ You want a **complete, professional project plan** for your **CampusCycle website**, specifically designed for development on **Replit**, so it can be used as a formal project document. Here’s a polished version:

---

# **Project Plan – CampusCycle: Sustainable Student Marketplace**

---

## **1. Project Title**

**CampusCycle – Sustainable Student Marketplace**

---

## **2. Project Overview**

CampusCycle is a **web-based platform designed exclusively for students** to promote **sustainability, affordability, and collaboration** within campus communities. The platform allows students to **buy, sell, exchange, or donate products** (like books, electronics, stationery, and furniture) and **offer/request services** (such as tutoring, assignment help, event assistance, and technical support).

The goal of CampusCycle is to create a **student-driven circular economy**, reduce campus waste, and provide students with a **safe, verified, and interactive marketplace** for both goods and services.

---

## **3. Problem Statement**

Students often struggle to afford essential items and frequently discard usable products. Meanwhile, many students have skills and services that remain untapped. There is no **unified platform for students to trade products and share services in a secure and sustainable way**. CampusCycle addresses this gap by combining a **marketplace and service hub** into a single platform focused on **reusability and eco-conscious practices**.

---

## **4. Project Objectives**

* Create a **student-only website** with secure authentication.
* Develop a **product marketplace** for buying, selling, exchanging, or donating items.
* Develop a **services module** for offering or requesting academic, technical, and creative services.
* Implement **chat functionality** for negotiations and communication.
* Integrate **EcoPoints and sustainability tracking** to promote reuse.
* Ensure **trust and reliability** through ratings, reviews, and student verification.

---

## **5. Scope of Work**

**CampusCycle** will include:

1. **User Authentication:** Student registration and login with college email verification.
2. **Product Marketplace:** Listings with images, categories, price, condition, and options to sell/exchange/donate.
3. **Services Marketplace:** Post and request services such as tutoring, projects, design, or event support.
4. **Chat System:** Direct messaging for product/service negotiation.
5. **EcoPoints System:** Reward students for donating or exchanging instead of discarding items.
6. **Admin Panel:** User verification, listing moderation, and activity monitoring.
